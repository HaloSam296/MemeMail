# MemeMail
A Python3 program that will pick a random meme and email out of a list and send the meme to the email. Not only that, but it will repeat this process at anytime between one minute and one hour (it's the best kind of spam bot, it's a meme spam bot).

The bulk of the code is in MemeMail_Functions. Main.py is the file to execute the program, and it is its own seperate file to keep the execution clean and simple. Plus whenever you want to remeove the wait time you don't have to add or remove a ton of indentions (like I had to before I had two seperate files of the code).
